# Summer Research
This is a repository for all my summer research related things.

## Running the models
All the current models are under the `first_attempt` directory. Once there cd into the whichever model you want to run, and run ```python -m scoop MLGP_main_threading.py```

## Explanation of the models
### "Seperate" MLGP Model (`MLGP` directory)
The simpliest model. Goes through the learning process twice. Once to produce a tree that predicts the valence, and once to produce the values for the arousal.
These trees are then simply combined.

### "Simple" MLGP Model (`simple_pred` directory):
A reasonably simple model. Unline the previous model, the whole tree is trained together in one run. And the error of each model is given by the euclidean distance between the prediction and the true value.

### Complex Number Model (`complex_num_pred` directory):
Very much like the previous model but the outputs are in the form of complex numbers (a+bi) instead of a tuple. The program also has a small "regression" layer where the output can be scaled or rotated (by multiplying the output by a complex number).

### Complex Regression MLGP mode (`complex_pred` directory):
Adds a regression layer on top after the prediction. Allows for the intermediate values predicted by the previous layers to be recombined in a bunch of different ways.

Assuming the lower layers produce some intermediate value (x, y). The regression layer allows for these to be combined in a more complex fashion. Eg. (x^2+y, sin(x)*y)
